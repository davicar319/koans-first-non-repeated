= First Non-Repeated Character Koans

A very simple koans-like project that finds and returns the first character in a string that
is not repeated anywhere in the string.  The problem is solved in a number of ways using old
and new Java features.  It is tested via Groovy and Spock.

== Problem Statement

The problem that this koans solves is to find and report the first character in a string
that is unique in that string.  If the string does not have any characters that are not
repeated it should return something to indicate that.  Part of this koans is to explore
how various return types help or hurt understanding and readability.
